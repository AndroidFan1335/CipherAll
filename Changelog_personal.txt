Having trouble with implementing the PyDes library into my methods and functions.  SInce the library translates strings into bytes, it makes it difficult to create a decrypt method that can 
utilize the library.  This makes total sense from a security standpoint, but nonetheless makes it difficult to code.  currently have placeholder DES and SED methods so work on the GUI can 
be completed.
